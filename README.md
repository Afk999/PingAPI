PingAPI gives you more control over how you reply to ping requests. You can download it <a href="http://www.spigotmc.org/resources/pingapi.3829/">here</a>

# Features

- Change the player sample (list of players shown when hovering over the player count)
- Fake the protocol name and version to display text instead of the player count
- Hide the player count
- Create server list animations (1.8 or before)

<h3>Creating a basic listener</h3>

To use PingAPI to its full potential you have to create a Listener. This is done similar to registering a Bukkit listener. Before we actually register it we need to create it. You can either create a new class that implements 'PingListener,' or just an anonymous inner class. Here is a simple example of a PingListener

<pre>
public class MyListener implements PingListener {
    public void onPing(PingEvent event) {
        event.getReply().setMOTD("This is an MOTD");
    }
}
</pre>

Now that we have created the PingListener we need to actually register it. You can do so by invoking the static method 'PingAPI.registerListener(PingListener).' Here is an example using an anonymous inner class.

<pre>
public class MyPlugin extends JavaPlugin {
    public void onEnable() {
        PingAPI.registerListener(new PingListener() {
        
            @Override
            public void onPing(PingEvent event) {
                event.getReply().setMOTD("This is an MOTD");
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>
